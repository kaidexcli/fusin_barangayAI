#  Auren AI — start Ollama so the browser can reach it. (macOS/Linux)
#
#  Run with:  ./start-ollama.sh      (once:  chmod +x start-ollama.sh)
#
#  It does the two things the app needs, in the right order:
#    1. frees port 11434 if a stale Ollama is already holding it
#    2. starts the server with OLLAMA_ORIGINS=* so the browser is
#       allowed to talk to it (without this you get a CORS error)
#
#  Step 1 is SKIPPED when the running server is already browser-reachable.
#  Killing a healthy Ollama drops the loaded model out of memory, and the
#  next reply then waits on a cold reload from disk for nothing.
#
#  Tired of running this? Make it permanent instead — see README
#  "Skip this step forever".

# already configured the way this script would configure it.
